This site tracks a lot of data from Habbo: Origins, like historical player count (Just look at that graph!) and interesting Origins facts.

Origins Tracker is currently developing a work-in-progress bug tracker where you can vote on bugs, leave comments, and share your tests! <br>There's also a furni value tracker in the works.

<b>Edit: </b>
As of 2025-10-03, Origins Tracker has been abandoned. The link to the website was "origins-tracker (dot) com"
